        <h3>Introduction</h3>

        <p>
            This week I am presenting what I think will be a pretty quick walk though on how to add UI Blocking
            to a React application. The classic use-case for this feature is blocking the UI from user input
            while some long running task, like an AJAX call, is taking place. We have two goals here. (1) Keep the
            user from taking further action until the long running task completes, and (2) make sure the user is
            informed as to why they are just sitting there doing nothing.
        </p>

        <p>
            Last time, we did the same thing for <a href="/#/blogs/angular2-and-ui-blocking">Angular 2</a> applications.
        </p>

        <p>
            This code produces an effect where the web page remains visible but is slightly grayed out, and
            a message and spinning gif are centered on the screen. Example:
        </p>

        <app-responsive-image fileName="blog/4/blocked.png"></app-responsive-image>

        <p>
            Hey, shameless plug... that's from my React project, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pickemleagues.com/">www.pickemleagues.com</a>.
            The website is for running NFL Pick Em leagues and Elimination leagues.
        </p>

        <h3>Tools</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>TypeScript 2.0.2</li>
            <li>React 15.3.0</li>
            <li>React-Redux 4.4.5</li>
            <li>Redux 3.5.2</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Step 1: Must Have: A Cool Spinner Gif</h3>

        <p>
            A cool spinner gif lets the user know important things are happening. We could just SAY important things
            are happening - and we will - but the gif really drives it home. Here's my current favorite site for acquiring
            such a gif, complete with custom colors and everything.
        </p>

        <p>
            <a target="_blank" href="http://loading.io/">loading.io</a>
        </p>

        <p>
            Create a nice spinner and save it somewhere local to your website (example: /img/box.gif).
        </p>

        <span class="spinner-span">
            <img src="/assets/img/blog/4/box.gif" />
        </span>

        <h3>Step 2: Create a UI Blocking Component</h3>

        <p>
            We need to create a UI blocking component. This piece is basically the HTML chunk that will be displayed
            when we block the user interface. This is a really basic example but the important feature here is that
            in addition to the displaying the spinner gif, we are adding a message.
        </p>

        <p>
            This is a React stateless functional component. If unfamiliar, more can read be about these
            <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/@housecor/react-stateless-functional-components-nine-wins-you-might-have-overlooked-997b0d933dbc#.r4pxqq95k">here</a>.
            The component returns null when not blocking, or the blocking HTML when it is blocking. This example is also using
            Redux-React to bind the state to the components props. We'll be looking at the state in just a minute.
        </p>

        <p>NOTE: The "in" and "modal-backdrop" css classes are from bootstrap.</p>

        <h3>Step 3: Add the CSS</h3>

        <p>
            One of the Angular 2 features I miss in React is having a separate CSS file specifically for each component.
            Over here in React land, we don't have that. We need to add some CSS for the component. In this example,
            I have an app.css file that is accessible to the entire application.
        </p>

        <app-git-hub-gist-renderer gist="32b7985e806fd67e93e700b7e7c319dd"></app-git-hub-gist-renderer>

        <h3>Step 4: Add Blocking to the State Contract</h3>

        <p>
            In React, everything that changes in the application is represented in the application's single state object.
            The UI blocker is no different. I have a TypeScript interface that defines my state contract. Here I
            add the state needed for the blocking component as IBlockUiState, and then I add that to the overall
            state contract.
        </p>

        <app-git-hub-gist-renderer gist="e8d78406f006d575d1013359d1e32f81"></app-git-hub-gist-renderer>

        <h3>Step 5: Adding a Blocking Action</h3>

        <p>
            With Redux, we define actions that are used to trigger state changes within the application.
            We add 3 things for every action.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>A string constant which represents the action. This will be used in the action creator and in the reducer. (we don't want any magic strings laying around)</li>
            <li>An interface that the action conforms to.</li>
            <li>A function that returns the action (called the action creator).</li>
        </ul>

        <app-git-hub-gist-renderer gist="b256cb1343a40b86febd622949a98749"></app-git-hub-gist-renderer>

        <p>
            If you want to delve more into Redux and React,
            <a target="_blank" href="http://redux.js.org/docs/basics/UsageWithReact.html">the docs</a>
            are a great place to start.
        </p>

        <h3>Step 6: Modify the Reducer</h3>

        <p>The reducer is a pure function that accepts actions, and creates a new state object with the requested changes.</p>

        <p>Note the incrementing and decrementing of the 'blockedCount' variable - this let's us nest calls to the blocker.</p>

        <app-git-hub-gist-renderer gist="45ff51bbd7a1c3dd8eadb9454ef7f25a"></app-git-hub-gist-renderer>

        <h3>Step 7: Add UI Blocking Component to Top Level Component</h3>

        <p>
            A React application typically has one top level component, but there could be several (one per page).
            We need to add the UI Blocker such that it is always present, which means adding it to every top level
            component. In my example there is only one top level component, App.tsx.
        </p>

        <app-git-hub-gist-renderer gist="d7c4b1b9253dd8dd401c104e3bd8a404"></app-git-hub-gist-renderer>

        <h3>Step 8: Block Some UI!</h3>

        <p>Now we can block UI from any component in the component tree, following these steps:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Import IAction and blockUi from actions.</li>
            <li>Use connect() from react-redux adds dispatch() to the component's props.</li>
            <li>Call props.dispatch(blockUi(true, message) to start blocking.</li>
            <li>Call props.dispatch(blockUi(false, "") to stop blocking.</li>
        </ul>

        <app-git-hub-gist-renderer gist="42b76e64f99671dc6ecc72f6cec60d9e"></app-git-hub-gist-renderer>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>

        <p>
            Compared to Angular 2, it feels like a bit more work here in React land. In fact, I know it
            is because I have 8 steps here compared to 6 for Angular 2. =) That's the general feeling I
            get doing a lot of things in React - features take a little more time to write. Gradually I have
            gotten used to that aspect, and after a while, writing new actions and reducers becomes
            second nature.
        </p>

        <p>
            In theory, this state loop can make your application more predictable. In general I agree -
            but it's not as if this is some magic bullet that will fix all your design problems. I like both React
            and Angular 2. I'd like to get into a full blown comparison of the two, but there are already a number
            of such articles out there. Both are good, and I wouldn't automatically recommend one over the other -
            without first reviewing an application's requirements and the development team's preferences and capabilities.
