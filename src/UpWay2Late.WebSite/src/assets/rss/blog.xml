			<title>Using the Angular 2 CLI with .NET Core 1.0 and Visual Studio 2015</title>
			<description>Before the current revision, this web site was most recently written in Angular 2. That was in April 2016,
            when Angular 2 was still in beta. I created it quite manually - not even knowing the Angular 2 CLI existed.
            I have rewritten it now that Angular 2 is RTM, using Angular CLI Beta 15. The site now also uses .NET Core,

			<description>I wrote my first blog post last week, and it didn't take long during that task to run into an all new
            issue worthy of a second post. I was blogging about Angular 2, and the Angular 2 CLI - and using both of
            them in the creation of the blog. So obviously, that blog post is going to contain some code examples. Adding
            those examples into an Angular 2 template proved to be a lot more problematic that I would have guessed. Here's
            what happened and how I solved (or maybe more accurately worked-around) the issues...</description>
